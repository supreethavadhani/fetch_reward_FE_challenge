## Improvements I could have made over time

* Implement caching to reduce the number of requests
* Use Lazy loading for images to improve loadtime.
* Improve the http error reporting
* Spend more time on the design and color pallet
* Write more test to improve code coverage
* Add a map api for filtering by location to improve the UX

## Requirements that were a bit unclear
 
 * Location filtering
 * What happens after a match is found

All in all this was a fantastic experience

# Installing Angular

This guide will show you how to install Angular on your machine. 

## Prerequisites

Before installing Angular, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

* [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Installing Angular CLI

Angular comes with a command line interface (CLI) that makes it easy to create and manage Angular applications. To install the Angular CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
